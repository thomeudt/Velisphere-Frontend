# Velisphere-Frontend
Frontend Modules and Long Term Data Store (Vertica based) for Velisphere IOT

Written in Java, requires Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 2.7 to compile to Javascript. It does work but is buggy and incomplete. Use GWT compiler to create a .WAR file and deploy on Apache Tomcat.

In order to make it work, you need to run the backend server as well (see seperate repository) and configure the IP addresses in the config file accordingly. Send me an E-Mail if you need help.

Screenshots of the Web UI can be found on my old project website http://www.connectedthingslab.com/

Requires GWT, Vertica Community Edition and several other (open source) libraries
