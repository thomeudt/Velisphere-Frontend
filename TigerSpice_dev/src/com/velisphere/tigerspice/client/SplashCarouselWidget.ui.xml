						VeliSphere Makes the Internet of Things Interactive.
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						The true inherent value of the internet of things
						will only materialize once the 1:1 relationship 
						between a device and the controlling app is overcome.
					    Our objective is to drive user value by defining a direct link between connected devices to
						allow for direct exchange of data and firing
						of actions based on a universal, user defined logic.

					<h4>
						VeliSphere is Multi Protocol Capable.
					</h4>
					<p>
						While the Internet of Things currently is in an 
						early, pre-standard phase, it will also require
						solutions for the integration of other, legacy
						connectivity methods such as various bus-architectures.
						Our goal is to provide gateways to various protocols and 
						legacy systems whereever possible through web services (HTTP/ReST or MQ) or physical gateway devices.

					<h4>
						VeliSphere Enables Devices Virtualization.
					</h4>
					<p>
						We will implement a virtualization layer on top of the physical device layer. Every physical device will have a virtual equivalent assigned, to
						which all configuration and logic will be applied.

						This principle will allow for easy replacement of failed devices just by reasigning the spare to the existing virtual 
						device as well as for easy batch configuration of entire fleets of devices of the same device class.
